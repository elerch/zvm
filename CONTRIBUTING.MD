# Contributing

Thank you for contributing to ZVM. I'm just one guy, so all contributions are
welcome and appreciated. However, in order to save us all some time, I've
decided to write up some basic rules for contributing that I'd like all future
P.R.'s to follow.

1. Please run `go fmt .` before submitting your P.R. Go is a very opinionated
   language, and how you define function can affect visibilty across the whole
   program. Unless your function needs to be used by a different package,
   default to private (lowercase names). You should also use camelCase for all
   your variables, functions, and fields. Submissions using snake case, kebab
   case, or any other case will be refused until adjusted to camel case.

2. I have a lot of obligations besides this repository so P.R.s may languish for
   a few days or weeks while I deal with my external obligations. It is
   important to me that you know that this is a very actively developed
   repository and all P.R.s will be reviewed within a month of submission.
   Probably sooner. If you would like to talk to me about your P.R. feel free to
   [email](mailto:tristan.isham@hey.com) me or reach out on Discord or Twitter.
   I check all regularly.

I hope you feel comfortable contributing to ZVM and know that I greatly
appreaciate every contribution. I'm just one person so seeing community members
care enough to write code for this project warms my heart. Thank you in advance.
